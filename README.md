# CS255-Portfolio

This repository contains system analysis and design documents for the **CS 255 course**, including the **Business Requirements Document** and the **System Design Document** for the DriverPass project.

## Project Summary
The **DriverPass** project was developed to address the challenges students face when preparing for their driving exams. The client, **DriverPass**, required an online platform that allows students to sign up for driving courses, schedule lessons, and track their progress. Additionally, administrators and instructors needed tools to manage bookings, monitor student performance, and ensure DMV compliance.

## Uploaded Artifacts
- **Business Requirements Document**: Defines the client's needs, system objectives, and key functional and non-functional requirements.
- **System Design Document**: Provides technical system architecture, UML diagrams, database structure, and security considerations.

## Reflection

### What did you do particularly well?
I excelled at clearly outlining system requirements and ensuring they aligned with the client's needs. My **functional requirements and system constraints** were well-structured, and my documentation was detailed yet concise, making it easy to follow.

### If you could revise one part of your work, what would you pick and why?
I would refine the **use case and sequence diagrams** to include more edge cases and alternative flows. While they effectively represent the main system interactions, a more detailed breakdown would enhance clarity for developers.

### How did you interpret the userâ€™s needs and implement them?
I analyzed the client's challenges and translated them into **functional and non-functional requirements**. By creating **user stories and process flows**, I ensured the system design addressed both student and instructor needs. The **role-based access control** and **scalable cloud infrastructure** were implemented to improve efficiency and security.

### Why is considering user needs important?
A well-designed system must prioritize usability and accessibility. Addressing **user needs** ensures the platform is intuitive, reduces errors, and enhances user engagement. Meeting these requirements also prevents costly rework in later development stages.

### How do you approach designing software?
I follow a structured **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** approach, starting with **requirement gathering**, followed by **design, implementation, testing, and deployment**. Moving forward, I would incorporate **Agile methodologies** to allow iterative improvements and user feedback.

## Repository Submission
This repository serves as an artifact for my **CS 255 coursework**, showcasing my ability to document, analyze, and design software systems effectively.
